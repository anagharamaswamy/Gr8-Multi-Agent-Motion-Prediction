# Gr8-Multi-Agent-Motion-Prediction

## Introduction
Motion Prediction is an application that is gaining importance with the increase in popularity of Self-Driving cars over the past decade. And it remains to be one of the most challenging aspects of fully-autonomous driving in complex societal scenarios.

This project is inspired on the competition hosted by Lyft called the Lyft Motion Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles. The challenge includes trying to build motion prediction models for self-driving vehicles. The model is also required to predict how cars, cyclists,and pedestrians move in the AV's environment.

## Dataset
The dataset is accessed via Kaggle. The complete dataset consisted of 170,000 scenes each over 25 seconds long. The lyft dataset captures the movements of a self driving vehicle, the state of traffic lights and participants around the vehicle. Each scene consists of about 248 frames with an average of 76.24 agents per frame. This project explores the performance of ResNet50, ResNeXt50 and Vision Transformer on the dataset.
